# dynamic-hdfs-hive
Dynamic Data Ingestion → HDFS with Automated Hive Integration  This is a ready‑to‑run starter kit you can paste into a repo or VM. It downloads a CSV from any HTTP(S) URL, lands it in HDFS, and builds an EXTERNAL Hive table that points to that data. It’s cron‑friendly and minimal.
